This script will automaticaly put all excel files in 1 file
- made for NFR005 mountbout scripts

TO DO BEFOREHAND
1) change the directory to the file where you have saved your files
2) define output file name
3) copy paste the file names that need combining
4) copy paste the sheet names
5) if you want to add the data_info sheet, copy paste this from another python script
